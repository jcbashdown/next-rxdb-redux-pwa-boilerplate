Please note that with this approach, the initial render on the server-side will not have access to the data fetched from RxDB. If you need to pre-populate the store with data on the server-side, you'll need to find alternative ways to fetch and serialize the data during SSR and hydrate the store on the client-side.

# TODO now

- make boilerplate
- Design rules for top level notes
  - Notes with no parents? Notes with only "RELATED" children?
  - Separate type for topics?
- Do write to rxdb (not just on init)
- sync rxdb to redux based on write coming from elsewhere (rxdb does resolution
  and is single source truth) - can I tdd this?

# Later

- ensure only one store and one db initialised
